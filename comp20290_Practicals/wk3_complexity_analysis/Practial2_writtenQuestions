Practical 2 - Exercise 1

Q. Use the Russian Peasant's algorithm to multiply the following two integers by hand: 68x139

A. Put the smaller number on the left to reduce the number of steps. Consequently, divide the number on the left by 2 ignoring the remainder and multiply 
the number on the right by 2. Lastly, add the numbers on the right together only if the corresponding number on the left is odd to get the result. 

68               139
34               278
17               556
8 (no remain.)  1112
4               2224
2               4448
1               8896

Adding the numbers together as specified above, we get: 68x139 = 556 + 8896 = 9452
