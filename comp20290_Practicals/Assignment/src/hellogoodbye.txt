Standing in the door
Of the Pink Flamingo
Crying in the rain
It was a kind of so-so love
And I'm gonna make sure
It never happens again
You and I, it had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were a sleep around
A lost and found
And not for me I fear
Whoa oh, oh
I tried to make it work
You in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit
Well, it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less
And now your life's a mess
So insecure you seem
I put up with all the scenes
And this is one scene
That's going to be played my way
Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Under the deep red light
I can see the makeup sliding down
Hey little girl
You will always make up
So take off that
Unbecoming frown
What about me, well
I'll find someone
That's not going cheap
In the sales
A nice little housewife
Who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails
Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look at my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
We've been involved for
Quite a while now
And to keep you secret
Has been hell
We're strangers meeting
For the first time, okay?
Just smile and say hello
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Say hello, then wave goodbye
Say hello, say goodbye
Goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Goodbye
